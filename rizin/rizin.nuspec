# Rizin

Rizin is a fork of the radare2 reverse engineering framework with a focus on
usability, working features and code cleanliness.

Rizin is portable and it can be used to analyze binaries, disassemble code,
debug programs, as a forensics tool, as a scriptable command-line hexadecimal
editor able to open disk files, and much more!

To learn more on Rizin you may want to read the
[official Rizin book](https://book.rizin.re).
