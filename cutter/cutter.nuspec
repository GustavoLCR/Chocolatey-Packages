# Highlights

## Decompiler

In this release, we introduce major improvements to the Decompiler feature in Cutter. These improvements couldn't be made without the help of our team member and GSoC student  [@NirmalManoj](https://github.com/NirmalManoj)  üëè

-   Context menu interactions with the decompiler are now context sensitive, only relevant menu items are shown and they applied to the item that was clicked
-   Decompiler based Syntax Highlighting in the Decompiler widget (old highlighting mode can be chosen in appearance options)
-   Support opening multiple Decompiler widgets at the same time. Each of the instances can be set to show different decompiler (Ghidra, RetDec, r2dec, ...) and different functions.
-   Make the current-address synchronization consistent with rest of widgets

**Known Limitations**

-   The new features in the Decompiler work best with r2ghidra, not all of them are implemented for r2dec
-   Some hacky features, like instruction patching, that were available in the previous context menu are not available in the new one and might be added in the future.
-   Decompiling large functions using r2ghidra causes UI to freeze temporarily

To read the full list of changes, check our blog post:  [Improving Decompiler Widget - GSoC Project](https://cutter.re/improving-decompiler-widget-gsoc)

## Radare2

-   Cutter 1.12.0 depends on radare2 4.5.1

## Other

-   Support analysis after opening the file
-   Configurable analysis options from the Preferences widget
